# ü´Ä Quantum Ecosystem for Efficient Medical Imaging

The Model that has been deployed is based on a **Quantum Machine Learning Architecture**, comprising of **ResNet(50)** and **Quantum Support Vector Machine(SVM)**. 

The architecture has been trained on the [ECG Images dataset of Cardiac Patients](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gwbz3fsgp8/2)  dataset, and achieves an accuracy of **87%**, which is an optimization from the Classical Architecture's accuracy of **58%**. 
The Predicted ECG Classes include **Normal**, **Abnormal Heartbeat**, **Myocardial Infarction**, and **History of Myocardial Infarction**.

The Quantum Ecosystem improves the time of the training from **15.8** s in Classical Environment to **13.7 s** in Quantum Environment. 

Deployment of this Ecosystem in Medical Imaging devices would help save **resources and time**, along with exponential optimization of results, hence reducing **human error**.

Heart rhythm problems (heart arrhythmias) occur when the electrical signals that coordinate the heart beats do not work properly. The faulty signaling causes the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia) or irregularly. Heart arrhythmias may feel like a fluttering or racing heart and may be harmless. However, some heart arrhythmias may cause bothersome ‚Äî sometimes even life-threatening ‚Äî signs and symptoms. However, sometimes it is normal for a person to have a fast or slow heart rate. For example, the heart rate may increase with exercise or slow down during sleep. Heart arrhythmia treatment may include medications, catheter procedures, implanted devices or surgery to control or eliminate fast, slow or irregular heartbeats. A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart damage that can trigger certain heart arrhythmias.')
